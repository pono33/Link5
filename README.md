## P5.js Animation

This sketch creates an animated pattern of lines using p5.js. The lines, that move around the canvas, are drawn from the center of each point to a point on a circle centered at the center of the canvas. The angle of the line is determined by a combination of the animation speed and the distance between the starting and ending points. The animation loop has a duration of 10 seconds, with 24 frames per second, and it generates a GIF.

To use this sketch, make sure you have the p5.js library loaded. You can customize parameters such as canvas size, grid size, and animation characteristics in the `setup` function. Experiment with the oscillation functions and line generation to create unique visual effects.



## Parameters

Certainly! Here's a brief description of the parameters used in your p5.js sketch:

1. **nb (Number):**
   - Represents the number of grid cells along one dimension. It determines the density of the grid.

2. **dim (Number):**
   - Represents the size of each grid cell. It is calculated based on the canvas width, margin, and the number of grid cells.

3. **margin (Number):**
   - Specifies the margin around the canvas. The grid is drawn within the canvas, excluding this margin.

4. **f (Number):**
   - Initial value for a variable used in the oscillation function. It affects the pattern of oscillation in the lines.

5. **frec (Number):**
   - Represents the frequency factor for the oscillation. It influences how fast the oscillation occurs.

6. **e (Number):**
   - A variable that appears to be defined but is not used in the provided code. It might be left from previous versions or could be intended for future modifications.
