## P5.js Animation

This code creates an animation of a grid of lines that move around the canvas. The lines are drawn from the center of each point to a point on a circle centered at the center of the canvas. The angle of the line is determined by a combination of the animation speed and the distance between the starting and ending points.

## Parameters

* `numPoints`: The number of points in the grid.
* `pointSize`: The size of each point.
* `marginSize`: The size of the margin around the canvas.
* `baseFrequency`: The base frequency of the animation.
* `animationSpeed`: The speed of the animation.
* `lineOpacity`: The opacity of the lines.

## Usage

To run the animation, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
